:pencil2: I started learning tech in 2019 and I started with Python. I used Python for Data Science, doing exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization and Machine Learning. It was really fun while starting out because Data Science was natural for me. I love Maths, Physics and I studied Mechanical Engineering. I beleive I got my analytical skills from my love for Science and Maths.   

:pencil2: You'll find me with my PC trying to solve a problem or watching tutorials online, Yea I'm self-taught and I spend a lot of time on my own learning. I love using Cousera, Freecodecamp, DataCamp and Kaggle.  Recently, I'm working on building my network, I'm a big fan of networking. I want to connect with other techies to learn, share ideas and oppurtunities  😕

:pencil2: This year I started writing, I'm still learning Technical Writing but I've written 3 articles already this month and I plan to write more the coming months. My love for Technical writing started when I was a teaching some kids maths. I taught them for about a year and I was working hard to create lesson plans, home works, extra reading to simplified the concepts I was teaching them. I started taking this kid Alegbra and He loved the way I was representing a variable as a container and trying to relate other things with maths. I knew I wanted to take complex stuffs and then simplify it for others. So I started writing.🤓

:pencil2: I'm an Aspiring Software Developer. hence, I'm open to opportunities, especially those that allows me to work remotely. Currently I'm a Mechanical Technician in a food producing company, I love the work and I love coding too 🙏🏻

:pencil2: I enjoy learning new technologies, I can quickly pick up a new tool, learn it and start using it. I love building 
stuffs that helps other people. I beleive that to strive in this competitive economy, A software Developer must build products or offer services that are rare and valuable. Devs also needs to be compassionate when writing codes, so that anyone else maintaining it in the future won't have so much to worry about. I like this quote: "Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
"
Perhaps a little over the top, but maybe that shock to the system is what we need to get this important point across to our fellow developers.
