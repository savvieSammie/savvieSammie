# Hi there! 👋 I'm [Your Name]

🌱 I started my tech journey in 2019, and Python was my first programming language. I fell in love with Python and began using it for Data Science, particularly in areas such as exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning. The natural connection between Data Science and my passion for Maths and Physics made the learning process incredibly enjoyable.

💻 You'll often find me in front of my PC, either solving problems or watching online tutorials. I'm a self-taught learner and dedicate a lot of time to expanding my knowledge. I rely on platforms like Coursera, FreeCodeCamp, DataCamp, and Kaggle to enhance my skills. Lately, I've been focusing on building my network because I'm a big believer in the power of networking. I'm eager to connect with fellow techies to learn, share ideas, and explore new opportunities. 😕

📝 This year, I ventured into the world of writing. Although I'm still learning the art of Technical Writing, I've already written more than 5 articles and plan to continue writing in the coming months. My passion for Technical Writing stems from my experience teaching math to children. During that time, I worked diligently to create lesson plans, homework assignments, and supplementary reading materials that simplified complex concepts. It was through this experience that I discovered my knack for breaking down complicated topics and making them accessible to others. So, I began my journey as a writer. 🤓

💼 I'm a Software Developer with 3 years of experience and actively seeking opportunities, particularly remote positions. 

🚀 I'm passionate about learning new technologies and quickly adapt to new tools. I find joy in building projects that help others. I firmly believe that to thrive in this competitive economy, software developers need to create products or provide services that are rare and valuable. Additionally, I value compassion in coding, ensuring that anyone maintaining my code in the future won't face unnecessary challenges. There's a quote I live by: "Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live." It may sound extreme, but it serves as a reminder to write clean and maintainable code. 😉

Let's connect! Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, discussions, or just to say hello. 📫
